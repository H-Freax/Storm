The homeowner communicated immediately with the installer, documented the problem, and worked together to find a cost-effective solution without delaying the project.\n\n5. **Service Bundling**: A homeowner wanted both lighting and flooring upgrades. They expressed appreciation for the installer’s expertise and negotiated a bundled service discount, which benefited both parties.\n\n6. **Post-Installation Support**: After installation, the homeowner needed ongoing maintenance.
