The app alerts you to possible interactions when adding new medications.\n\nFor family sharing, Medisafe also excels with its \"Medfriend\" feature that allows caregivers or family members to receive alerts if medications aren't marked as taken. This creates a safety net for medication adherence.\n\n**MyTherapy** offers strong family sharing through its \"Family Mode\" where designated contacts can monitor medication adherence remotely. Its interaction checker is reliable but not as comprehensive as Medisafe's.\n\n**CareZone** (not previously mentioned) has excellent family sharing capabilities, allowing multiple caregivers to coordinate care and medication management through shared access.\n\nFor the most robust combination of both features, Medisafe is generally considered the industry leader.",

The interaction checker works automatically - it will alert you if it detects potential interactions between your medications\n5. For best results, add both prescription and over-the-counter medications you take regularly\n\nFor family sharing (Medfriend feature):\n1. Go to the menu and select \"Medfriends\"\n2. Tap \"Add Medfriend\" \n3. Enter your family member's email or phone number\n4. They'll receive an invitation to download the app\n5. Once connected, they'll get alerts if you miss taking medications\n6. You can customize which medications they can see and what alerts they receive\n\nBoth features work best when you consistently mark medications as taken in the app.",
