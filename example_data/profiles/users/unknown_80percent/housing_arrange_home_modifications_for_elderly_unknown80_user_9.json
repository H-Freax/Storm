    "description": "Michael, a 52-year-old project manager from a suburban area, has extensive experience in managing home improvement projects and is known for his analytical approach. With a casual communication style, he carefully weighs options before making decisions, though he prefers to communicate indirectly. Recently, he has become more invested in arranging modifications to his elderly parents' home, driven by a sense of urgency due to their declining mobility, combined with his detail-oriented nature and willingness to take calculated risks for the sake of their safety.",
