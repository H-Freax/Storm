    "description": "Ayodele is a 22-year-old Nigerian who enjoys a mix of social interactions but often prefers to stay reserved. As a beginner in technology, he approaches cognitive exercises cautiously, driven by a rational mindset and a desire to prevent cognitive decline in his family, which he learned about through extensive reading. His athletic background and very expressive personality contribute to his enthusiasm for activities that engage both mind and body, despite feeling impatience when faced with prolonged tasks.",
