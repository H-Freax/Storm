    "description": "Aiko is a 22-year-old student who takes a professional approach to her studies despite being a beginner in the tech field. Growing up in an Eastern culture, she values direct communication but often remains reserved in social settings, particularly in public spaces where she feels the weight of social pressure. Motivated by a desire to maintain cognitive health and prevent dementia, Aiko is actively seeking visual learning exercises that suit her limited mobility and impulsive decision-making style.",
