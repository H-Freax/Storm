    "description": "Fatima is a 68-year-old retired teacher from a small town in the Middle East. Known for her outgoing personality, she enjoys engaging with others despite her limited experience with technology. With a moderate level of patience and a desire to make her home more comfortable as she ages, Fatima is motivated to arrange modifications that will ensure her independence and safety, particularly given her very expressive nature which drives her to communicate her needs directly.",
