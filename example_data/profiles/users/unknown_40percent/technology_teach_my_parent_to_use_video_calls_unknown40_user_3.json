    "name": "Laura Hayes",
    "description": "Laura is a 30-year-old professional living in a suburban area, known for her reserved demeanor and balanced decision-making style. With an intermediate level of tech experience, she feels a sense of urgency to teach her elderly parent how to use video calls, understanding the importance of connecting with family during these times. Although she tends to be risk-averse and values detail in her communication, she remains moderately expressive when guiding others, balancing her patience and the need to adapt instructions for her parent's comfort.",
