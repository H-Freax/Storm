    "description": "Emma Thompson is a 22-year-old university student with advanced technical skills, spending much of her time studying and engaging with online platforms. Friendly in nature yet reserved in expressiveness, she approaches challenges with caution, preferring to thoroughly analyze details before making decisions. Currently, she seeks an accessible home due to her desire for independence, but her risk-averse attitude and limited previous experience in real estate make her approach careful and well-researched.",
