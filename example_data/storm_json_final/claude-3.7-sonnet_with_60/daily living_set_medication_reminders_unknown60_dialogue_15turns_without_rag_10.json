Known for his analytical mind, he often makes impulsive decisions, particularly when under time constraints, which fuels his interest in setting medication reminders to enhance his routine and avoid missing doses. He tends to communicate in detail but prefers simple language, making him focused on practical solutions despite his moderate expressiveness.",
