Point out key buttons like:\n   - **Mute/Unmute**: Bottom left corner.\n   - **Start Video/Stop Video**: Next to the mute button.\n   - **Participants**: Shows who is in the meeting.\n   - **Chat**: Access to send messages.\n\n2. **Practice**: Have them practice clicking these buttons while on a test call. This builds confidence.\n\n3. **Use a Guide**: Create a simple guide with screenshots of the interface, labeling each button's function.\n\n### Joining a Meeting:\n1. **Meeting Link**: Show them how to click on the meeting link you send. Explain that it will open Zoom automatically.\n\n2. **Entering Meeting ID**: If they need to enter a meeting ID:\n   - Open Zoom and click \"Join.\"\n   - Enter the meeting ID and their name, then click \"Join.\"\n\n3. **Waiting Room**: Explain that they may enter a waiting room before being admitted. They should wait patiently.\n\n4. **Testing Audio/Video**: Remind them to check audio and video settings when prompted before joining.\n\nWould you like more tips or assistance with anything else?",
