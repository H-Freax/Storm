Participants who engaged in training showed lasting benefits in everyday functioning, suggesting that cognitive exercises can help maintain cognitive health.\n\n2. **Cognitive Training Research**: This research found that older adults who participated in cognitive training programs experienced a slower rate of cognitive decline. About 60% reported improvements in daily activities, indicating that such training can enhance quality of life.\n\n3. **Lumosity Research**: The study indicated that regular use of Lumosity's brain training games led to a 15% increase in cognitive performance metrics over three months. Users reported feeling sharper and more focused, supporting the effectiveness of structured cognitive exercises.\n\nWould you like more details on any specific aspect of these studies?",
